# multiplayer-demo
 I used Unity's Photon engine to create a simple multiplayer experience hosted on this repo's GitHup pages deployment.
 ## How to Play
- Take control of a spaceship with WASD + SPACE to fly around and shoot at exploding targets in a mutliplayer environment.
- Anyone should be able to join a common lobby from any browser anywhere.
